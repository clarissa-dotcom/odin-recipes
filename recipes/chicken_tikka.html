        <p>This classic Indian dish is our go-to when we order takeout, but it's actually so easy to make at home.</p>
        <p>Packed with flavor, the creamy, spiced sauce covers tender pieces of chicken, just waiting to be served with  homemade naan and perfect basmati rice.</p>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, grated</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. grated peeled fresh ginger (from a 1" piece)</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tsp. garam masala</li>
            <li>2 tsp. ground coriander</li>
            <li>2 tsp. ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp. ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/3 c. plus 1 tbsp. tomato paste, divided</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 c. whole-milk yogurt</li>
            <li>2 lb. skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. vegetable oil or ghee</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 to 3 fresh red chiles, seeded and finely chopped, or 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 1/2 c. tomato puree</li>
            <li>1 c. heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix garlic, ginger, garam masala, coriander, turmeric, cumin, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, and 1/4 teaspoon salt until a paste forms.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, stir yogurt, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and half of spice paste until well combined; cover and refrigerate remaining spice paste. Place chicken on a cutting board. Using a paring knife, make a few shallow cuts in each breast. Add to bowl and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours. </li>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and chiles and cook, stirring often, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add remaining 1/3 cup tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining spice paste and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato puree and 1/2 cup water, scraping up any browned bits in bottom of pot. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring often and reducing heat to low if needed to maintain a gentle simmer, until mixture thickens, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in cream and gently simmer, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat broiler with an oven rack 6" from heat. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack inside sheet. Transfer chicken with marinade to rack and arrange in a single layer. Spoon any remaining marinade in bowl over chicken. Broil until chicken is mostly cooked and marinade has thickened and is golden in spots (chicken will not be fully cooked at this point), 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut chicken into bite-size chunks. Add chicken and cilantro to tomato mixture. Very gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes; season with 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Divide rice among bowls. Spoon chicken tikki masala over. Top with cilantro. Serve with naan alongside.</li>
        </ol>
